# Blobfish::Ejbca demo

## Notes

### EJBCA authentication credentials

Current demonstration project includes credentials for an user with superadministrator role (`superadmin_llama.cer` y `superadmin_llama.key`), but in a production environment, credentials for a client of this type should be restricted as much as possible, **credentials for an administrator should not be used!**.
