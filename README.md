# Blobfish::Ejbca demo

## Notes

### EJBCA authentication credentials

Current demonstration project includes credentials for an user with superadministrator role (`client.cer` y `client.key`), but in a production environment, credentials for a client of this type should be restricted as much as possible, **credentials for an administrator should not be used!**.
